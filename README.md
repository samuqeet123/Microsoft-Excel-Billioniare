Excited to share my latest project: The Billionaires Dashboard 2025! 

This interactive dashboard, built using Microsoft Excel, offers a comprehensive view of the world's billionaires, 
including their net worth, average age, and industry distribution. Here's a quick overview of the workflow I followed:

Dashboard Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis.
2. Data Analysis: Analyzed the billionaire data to uncover key insights and trends.
3. Dashboard Structure: Designed a clear and intuitive structure to present key metrics and insights.
4. Charts & Visuals: Used various Excel charts to visually represent data trends and comparisons.
5. Making it Interactive: Added dynamic filters and slicers for regions, self-made status, and gender to enhance interactivity.

What I Learned:
1. Advanced Excel functionalities like data cleaning, dynamic filtering, and charting.
2. Data visualization techniques to present complex information clearly.
3. Hands-on experience in building dashboards for business insights.

I'm looking forward to your feedback and suggestions!
